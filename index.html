                <p>I'm a Responsive Front-End Web Developer aspiring to create the smoothest and most user friendly websites around.
                However, I am not <em>just</em> a Web Developer; I am also a singer, songwriter, artist, movie buff, and a proud mother
                of one cat.</p>

            <div id="occupation" class="flex-items">
                <p>I currently work for a private establishment called Soho House, namely, Soho Warehouse, in Downtown Los Angeles.
                    My position there is Front Desk Agent. While the job has its moments of enjoyment and while I view my coworkers as
                    amazing friends of mine, the job itself is a little too emotionally and mentally demanding for me. WHich is why
                    I hope to work a job that is more my speed- introvert friendly, challenges my mind rather than my emotions, and encourages
                    my love of travel and music outside of work.
                </p>

            <div id="passions" class="flex-items">
                <p>One of my biggest passions is music! To me, music is one of the strongest expressions of one's deepest thoughts,
                    emotions, desires, and fears. Writing music has helped me get through some pretty rough times, and I like to think
                    that it has helped others as well. I love listening to music as well, my current obsession is Japanese Rock.

            <div id="coding" class="flex-items">
                <p>Learning and doing code is no easy task. But, while I've faced many challenges on this journey, I've still had a lot of fun
                    learning! It's so easy to lose interest and give up on things the moment it gets hard, but when it comes to coding, every fail just gives me
                    more determination and motivation to do better. I've still got a lot to learn, but I'm excited for every step of the way, and I can't wait to get even better
                    at coding with time.
